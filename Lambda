I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are right; addition, subtraction, and multiplication are objects of anonymous 
classes implementing the MathOperation interface using lambda expressions.

In Java, lambda expressions are a concise way to represent an instance of a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method).
When we define a lambda expression, the compiler creates an anonymous class instance that implements the functional interface's abstract method.
